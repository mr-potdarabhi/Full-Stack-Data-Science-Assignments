    "**Ans**: Shutil module provides a funciton called as `shutil.rmtree()` which deletes a directory and all its contents. The other functions with similar functionality are `os.remove()` -> removes a file, `os.rmdir()` removes a empty directory. The problem with these functions is once a file is deleted. it will be lost permanently, if a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file\n",

    "\\\n",
    "Where as send2trash module provides a function called `send2trash.send2trash()` to delete a file/directory. these methods moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them. hence if a file/folder is deleted accidentally it can be still recovered from trash folder, if is deleted using the `send2trash.send2trash()` function. send2trash is not included with python standard libary like os & shutil modules. it needs to be installed explicitly using the command `!pip install send2trash`"
