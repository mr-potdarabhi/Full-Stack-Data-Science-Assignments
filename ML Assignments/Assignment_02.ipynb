    "\n",
    "    1.Learning to cook: Imagine someone who wants to learn how to cook. They start by following simple recipes and instructions. As they try different techniques and experiment with ingredients, they learn what works well and what doesn't. With practice, they develop a sense of taste, timing, and creativity in the kitchen. Over time, they become more skilled and confident in their cooking abilities.\n",

    "    2.Learning to ride a bike: When someone learns to ride a bike, they begin by trying to balance on two wheels. They may wobble and fall a few times, but each attempt teaches them how to adjust their body and maintain balance. As they practice more, they develop muscle memory and coordination, making it easier to ride without falling. Eventually, they can ride confidently without consciously thinking about their movements."

    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning (Human):** In supervised learning, a person learns by being provided with labeled examples or feedback. They learn to associate input data with correct output labels or responses. For example, a teacher showing a child pictures of animals and telling them their names (e.g., \"This is a cat, and this is a dog.\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning (Machine):** In machine learning, supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled datasets. The algorithm learns to make predictions or classifications based on input features and corresponding known outputs. For example, training a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits by providing labeled images of digits along with their respective labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning (Human):** Unsupervised learning refers to learning without explicit labels or feedback. It involves finding patterns, structures, or relationships in the data without predefined categories or guidance. An example is when a person discovers similarities and differences in a set of objects or data points without prior knowledge or instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised Learning (Machine):** Machine learning also has unsupervised learning methods. These algorithms analyze and discover patterns or structures in unlabeled datasets. They can be used for tasks like clustering similar data points or reducing the dimensionality of data to identify underlying patterns or relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning (Human):** Reinforcement learning involves learning through interaction with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. Individuals learn to take actions that maximize rewards and minimize negative consequences. An example is when a person learns to play a video game and adjusts their strategy based on rewards or penalties received during gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement Learning (Machine):** In machine learning, reinforcement learning algorithms learn to make decisions or take actions based on rewards received in a given environment. They learn through trial and error, exploring different actions and receiving feedback to maximize cumulative rewards. Examples include training an algorithm to play games or control autonomous systems.\n",

In this case, historical data on house prices along with the corresponding features are used to train a regression model.

It aims to identify natural clusters or subgroups within a dataset without prior knowledge of their labels or categories. The clustering mechanism can be described in detail as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Representation:** Clustering starts with a dataset consisting of multiple data points, where each data point represents an object, an observation, or a set of features.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. **Assignment Step:** In this step, each data point is assigned to the cluster whose centroid is closest to it based on the chosen similarity measure. The distance between a data point and each centroid is calculated, and the data point is assigned to the cluster with the minimum distance.\n",
